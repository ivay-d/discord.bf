> **Note**: Contributions to this repository are made by pull requests. If you are new to GitHub please familiarize yourself with the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)

## How To Contribute
In this part we will talk about:
  - [What you need to know](#what-to-know)
  - [Making an issue](#issues)
  - [Setup the project in your terminal](#setup)
  - [Guidelines](#guidelines)
  - Testing your changes
  - Making pull request

### What to know
We appreciate the enthusiasm but before starting to contribute you need to know a few things. This includes (but not limited to):
  - C++
  - Brainfuck
  - GitHub forking/issues/pull requests 

### Issues
Issues are a great way to report bugs or request new features, before making a pull request we ask you to create an issue with the feature you are going to add and reference it in the pull requests you create. (Psst, remember you don't need to create a pull request. Maybe someone will code your idea, who knows.).

### Setup
To begin you first need to install [git](https://git-scm.com/doc).
 
 After installing git open your termnal and run:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/ivay-d/discord.bf
 cd discord.bf 
 ls
 ```
> **Note**: We have a cli to make your contribution smoother. You can install it from [here](https://github.com/ivay-d/discord.bf-cli).

### Guidelines
 To keep the project consistent and easy to read for everyone, please follow the guidelines.

   - Files names must be snake\_case (i.e. file\_name.cpp)
   - Follow the code style, our code style might be a little weird so we made a [file](./CODE_STYLE.md) talking about it.
   - Make the commit messages meaningful (e.g. Fixed the bug where bots couldn't stay in the voice chat for long times)
   - Try to keep the pull requests small, reviewing 200-line change is easier than 4000-line change.
   - Comments are optional but will be very appreciated if you add them. This makes it easier to review the code.
